            self.name = name
            self.children = []

        def add_child(self, child_node):
            self.children.append(child_node)

    # Creating a hierarchical file system tree
    root = TreeNode("Root")
    documents = TreeNode("Documents")
    pictures = TreeNode("Pictures")

    root.add_child(documents)
    root.add_child(pictures)
```
   - In this example, the TreeNode class models a node in the tree, allowing for the creation of a hierarchical file system.

**Symbol Tables for Compilers**:
