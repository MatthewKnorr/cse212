### Using Queue in Python
In the Python programming landscape, the built-in queue module offers a dedicated Queue class, providing an efficient and straightforward implementation of queues. Let's delve into the intricacies of utilizing this class through illustrative examples.
Example 1: Basic Queue Operations

Let's begin with a fundamental example illustrating the practical implementation of the Queue class:

```python

from queue import Queue

# Creating a Queue instance
my_queue = Queue()

# Enqueuing elements
my_queue.put(10)
my_queue.put(20)
my_queue.put(30)

# Dequeuing elements
first_element = my_queue.get()
second_element = my_queue.get()

# Displaying the results
print("Dequeued Elements:", first_element, second_element)
```
In this example, we instantiate a Queue object, enqueue elements, and subsequently dequeue elements, showcasing the intuitive usage of the Queue class.
Example 2: Academic Task Scheduling

In the context of academic task scheduling, the Queue class provides an elegant solution for managing assignments in a systematic manner. Consider the following code snippet:

```python

from queue import Queue

# Creating a Queue instance for academic tasks
academic_tasks_queue = Queue()

# Enqueuing academic tasks
academic_tasks_queue.put("Research Paper")
academic_tasks_queue.put("Math Homework")
academic_tasks_queue.put("History Assignment")

# Dequeuing and processing tasks
while not academic_tasks_queue.empty():
    current_task = academic_tasks_queue.get()
    print(f"Processing Task: {current_task}")
    # Additional logic for task processing can be added here
```

In this example, an instance of the Queue class is created to represent a queue for academic tasks. Tasks, such as a research paper or math homework, are enqueued, and a loop is employed to dequeue and process each task in FIFO order. This mirrors the systematic execution of academic tasks, ensuring that they are handled in the order they are received.
Example 3: Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal

Expanding on the versatility of the Queue class, let's explore its application in a BFS traversal scenario. Consider a simple graph represented as an adjacency list:

```python

from queue import Queue

# Sample graph represented as an adjacency list
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

# BFS traversal using a Queue
def bfs_traversal(start_node):
    visited = set()
    bfs_queue = Queue()

    bfs_queue.put(start_node)
    visited.add(start_node)

    while not bfs_queue.empty():
        current_node = bfs_queue.get()
        print(f"Visiting Node: {current_node}")

        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                bfs_queue.put(neighbor)
                visited.add(neighbor)

# Perform BFS traversal starting from node 'A'
bfs_traversal('A')
```

In this example, the Queue class is used to implement a BFS traversal of a graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, and the BFS algorithm explores nodes level by level. The queue ensures that nodes are processed in the order they are discovered, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Queue class in algorithmic implementations.

    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = None  # Pointer to the left child
        self.right = None  # Pointer to the right child

# Function to insert a new node into the Binary Search Tree
def insert_node(root, key):
    if root is None:
        # If the tree is empty, create a new node with the given key
        return TreeNode(key)
    if key < root.key:
        # If the key is less than the current node's key, go to the left subtree
        root.left = insert_node(root.left, key)
    else:
        # If the key is greater than or equal to the current node's key, go to the right subtree
        root.right = insert_node(root.right, key)
    return root

# Function for in-order traversal of the Binary Search Tree
def in_order_traversal(root):
    result = []
    if root:
        # Traverse the left subtree
        result = in_order_traversal(root.left)
        # Append the current node's key
        result.append(root.key)
        # Traverse the right subtree
        result += in_order_traversal(root.right)
    return result

# Example usage
# Initialize an empty tree
tree_root = None
# List of keys to insert into the tree
keys = [50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]
# Insert each key into the tree
for key in keys:
    tree_root = insert_node(tree_root, key)
# Perform in-order traversal and print the result
print("In-order Traversal:", in_order_traversal(tree_root))
